  - interpolation
  - trace (sys prop to path?)
  - eager vs lazy search (pre-compute all props for given context)
  - dump all prop values with origin (in priority order)
  - functional test framework (file-driven)
  - make error handling more consistent while loading files. always throw?
  - data structure stats
  - algorithm is no longer an especially great match for the common use case. might
    be nice to re-arrange it.
